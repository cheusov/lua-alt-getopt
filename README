lua_altgetopt is a MIT-licenced module for Lua programming language
for processing application's arguments the same way
POSIX getopt(3) and BSD/Solaris getopt_long(3) functions do.

Main features and goals:
1) Compatibility with POSIX, that is, SUS "Utility Syntax Guidelines"
   guidelines 3-12
   http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_02
2) This module is written in plain Lua
2) No extra dependencies
3) No hooks, no functional tricks ;-)
4) Support for long options, e.g. compatibility with getopt_long(3) C function
   present in *BSD and Solaris operating systems
6) Strict error checking, i.e., checks for an incorrect use of options
7) Unlike GNU getopt(3) and getopt_long(3) lua_altgetopt does not permute the contents
   of argv as it scans. This means lua_altgetopt strictly conforms to POSIX rules
   of options parsing
8) Two ways of options handling are provided.
   See alt_getopt.get_ordered_opts and alt_getopt.get_opts functions
